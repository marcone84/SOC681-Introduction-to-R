# Introduction to Computational Sociology
## Multi-modal data and cultural sociology
- Bail (2014) writes that "[S]ocial scientists—and cultural sociologists in particular—have largely ignored the promise of so-called “big data.” Instead, cultural sociologists have left this wellspring of information about the arguments, worldviews, or values of hundreds of millions of people from Internet sites and other digitized texts to computer scientists who possess the technological expertise to extract and manage such data but lack the theoretical direction to interpret their meaning."

# Introduction to Computational Sociology
## Some attempts at a definition
1. Use of non-numeric and multimodal data (image, text, video)
2. New digital modes of data collection (web-scraping, APIs, online experiments)
3. Application of computational methods developed by computer scientists (topic modeling, word embeddings, deep learning)

# Course outline
## Goals
- By the end of this course you should be able to
    - Understand the field of computational sociology and computational social science more broadly
    - Code using R at an intermediate level
    - Understand and implement various computational methodologies for data collection and analysis
    - Apply computational methods in your own research
    - Think critically about the use of new data sources and methods

# Why R?

# Why R?

-   Free and open-source
-   A statistical programming language
    -  Many cutting-edge approaches now implemented in R before Stata
    - Rutgers Sociology will transition to R for the grad stats sequence
-   Alongside Python, it is one of the main programming languages used by data scientists
-   A very active developer community
-   RStudio

# RStudio
## Overview
-   RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment for programming in R
    -   Run code in the console or in scripts
    -   Easy to view data, objects in memory, plots
    -   Easy to create output such as papers or slides
    -   Terminal interface
    -   Integrations including Github and Python

# RMarkdown
## Overview
-   RMarkdown is an interactive coding environment
    -   RMarkdown documents can combine text, LaTeX code, R code, and any output.
    - Write in Markdown or Visual Editor
    -   These slides are rendered using RMarkdown
    -   You will be using RMarkdown for your homework assignments and hopefully your papers


# Slack
## Why Slack?
- Quick and easy communicate
    - Reduces need to email
    - Shared problem solving
- Code formatting
    - Use "```" to start a code snippet (Slack should auto-complete)
- Emojis!

# Other resources
- StackOverflow
    - An online community for coding questions
        - Search for error messages or snippets. In most cases you should be able to find answers to your issues. 
        - Sometimes it can take a while to figure out the appropriate query to use to find an answer.
        - If you can't find an answer, you can make your own question - but the formatting requirements are quite strict and users can be unforgiving.
    - A useful thread for posting an R question and example: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example
