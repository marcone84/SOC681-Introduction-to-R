# COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course is designed to introduce students to computational methods and their applications to sociological research. We will discuss the computational toolkit from the bottom up, beginning with the fundamentals of programming and data analysis and management. Once these fundamentals are in place, we will turn to different methods for collecting data: application programming interfaces, web-scraping, and online experiments. The remainder of the course will focus on computational methods for data analysis. First, we will cover various methods for the quantitative analysis of text data including word embeddings, topic modeling, and supervised learning. Second, we will discuss supervised machine learning in more depth, assessing the relationship between prediction and explanation in social science, discussing bias and other limitations of these methods, as well as the opportunities these techniques present to work with images and multimodal data. Finally, we will explore the role of simulation and agent-based modeling in sociological research. Throughout the course students will gain hands-on experience with these different techniques, as well as an understanding of how these techniques are being used in cutting-edge sociological research. Overall this course will provide students with a strong conceptual foundation in computational sociology and the ability to apply various techniques for data collection and analysis in their own research. All assignments will be conducted using the R programming language.


# PREREQUISITES AND PREPARATION
This course is designed for students without any experience using computational methods or advanced statistics. Nonetheless, the course will proceed more efficiently if students without any such experience are willing to undertake some independent learning prior to the beginning of the course. In particular, I recommend students familiarize themselves with Github, the R programming language, the RStudio computing environment, and RMarkdown documents, as we will be using these tools throughout the course. We will review these topics over the first few weeks of class, but the more familiar students are with these tools, the more time we can spend focusing on their sociological applications. Information on learning resources is provided on the course website.

# ASSESSMENT
There will be two types of assessment used in the course. There will be four homework assignments (each worth 10% of the final grade) designed to help students to become familiar with the various methodological techniques covered in the course. A schedule of these assignments can be found in the course outline below. Students will also write an empirical paper over the course of the semester, worth 60% of the final grade. The paper will involve the collection of original data and preliminary analyses using one or more of the approaches covered in the course. I intend for the paper to be an opportunity for students to develop the basis for a qualifying exam, master's thesis, or dissertation chapter. Students are expected to make progress on the paper over the course of the semester. At various points in the semester there will be three submissions related to the final paper (each worth 5% of the final grade): the paper proposal, initial data collection and descriptive analysis, and the implementation of methodological approach  (see course outline for a timeline). Each of these stages will be an opportunity to gain feedback on the final paper.

# READINGS
There are weekly reading assignments for this course. These readings include methodological texts, reviews of relevant methodological and theoretical considerations, and examples of how sociologists and other social scientists apply computational approaches in their research. Given the complexity and unfamiliarity of some of the approaches we will cover in the course, I have included a diverse set of readings for each topic. Some students may find the technical readings more useful whereas others may benefit from the more contextualized applications.

# RESOURCES

There will be a Github repository containing all files related to this course (A link will be shared in the first week of class). I will also use this as a space to maintain a wiki links to various related resources. Students will also use Github to submit assignments. We will be using Slack to communicate with one another during this course, all enrolled students will receive an invite to join the Slack channel.

# COURSE POLICIES

The Rutgers Sociology Department strives to create an environment that supports and affirms diversity in all manifestations, including race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age, social class, disability status, region/country of origin, and political orientation. This class will be a space for tolerance, respect, and mutual dialogue. Students must abide by the Code of Student Conduct  at all times, including during lectures and in participation online. 

All students must abide by the university’s Academic Integrity Policy. Violations of academic integrity will result in disciplinary action.

In accordance with University policy, if you have a documented disability and require accommodations to obtain equal access in this course, please contact me during the first week of classes. Students with disabilities must be registered with the Office of Student Disability Services and must provide verification of their eligibility for such accommodations. 

I will also be making additional accommodations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If you or your family are affected in any way that impedes your ability to participate in this course, please contact me as soon as you can so that we can make necessary arrangements.
