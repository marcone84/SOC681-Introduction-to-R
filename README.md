## Preparation

This section will help to familiarize students with the tools we will be using throughout the semester. Please read it carefully and ensure you have completed the checklist by the second week of classes.

I have an up-to-date copy of the syllabus [here](https://github.com/t-davidson/computational-sociology/blob/main/syllabus/syllabus.pdf). Here you will find links to all of the readings for the semester. All of the books are available for free online. Below are some helpful resources for learning about R, RStudio, RMarkdown, and Github.

### R
The most useful thing you can do to prepare for this course is to familiarize yourself with R.

Chris Bail at Duke has recorded a series of short videos introducing R. You can find a Twitter thread and a link to the materials [here]([https://twitter.com/chris_bail/status/1303496513918771203?lang=en](https://sicss.io/boot_camp/)). These videos are intended to serve as an introduction to programming in R for a social science audience. They were created as a resource for participants in the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science without much prior experience.

The main textbook we will be using this semester is R for Data Science (R4DS) by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund (which Bail also uses in the videos discussed above). We will work through most of this book over the first few weeks of the semester. I have indicated the relevant chapters each week. The textbook focuses on using R to work with data, drawing upon a set of packages known as the `tidyverse` (the first author Hadley Wickham is the lead developer). It is a well-organized and easy-to-follow introduction to the fundamentals of R. If you have the time, I would recommend starting to read (or skim) through the chapters listed in the syllabus and using RStudio to test out some of the examples (if you use the online version of the book you can easily copy over the code).

### RStudio
We will be using RStudio for assignments in this class. You can download the free version of RStudio Desktop [here](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) that has a great deal of helpful functionality. You can use it for a range of tasks, including to write and run code, finding help, viewing plots, and inspecting data.

### RMarkdown
RMarkdown is a framework designed by the developers of RStudio that allows you to combine code, text, and other elements into the same document. RMarkdown can create slideshows and other documents. For example, the course syllabus and the slides I will use in the lectures are both created in RMarkdown. Course assignments (and potentially your final papers) will be written using RMarkdown. I recommend taking a look at [this tutorial](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html).

### Github
Github is a website used to store and share code. The most useful aspect of Github is *version control*. If you regularly store your code on Github then it is easy to keep a record of your work over time (similar to tracked changes in Word documents). All course materials will be hosted in a Github repository. You will be using Github to submit your course assignments.

You can sign up to Github [here](https://github.com) (no need to pay, sign up for a free account). As students, you can get free access to certain paid features by signing up for a [student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack). Once you have made your account, follow the instructions here. You will likely need to upload a copy of your student ID as evidence. They should provide you with access within a few days.

Once you have an account, [this](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) tutorial will introduce you to most of what you will need to know.
